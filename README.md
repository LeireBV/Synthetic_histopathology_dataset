# Unleashing the Potential of Synthetic Images: Histopathology Image Classification

Welcome to the repository for the dataset used in the paper titled **"Unleashing the Potential of Synthetic Images: A Study on Histopathology Image Classification"**.

## Overview

This repository will host synthetic histopathology images generated for research purposes. The dataset is intended for use in exploring and evaluating histopathology image classification methods.

## Dataset

The dataset will be uploaded soon. It will include synthetic histopathology images and the subsets employed to train the model.

## Original Dataset Reference

The synthetic images in this repository were generated using the [PCam dataset](https://github.com/basveeling/pcam). Please refer to the original dataset for more details.
